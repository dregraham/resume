    "bio": "I’m a Cloud Computing graduate who’s spent the last few years deep in the world of AWS, Azure, and Windows systems. My background in technical support taught me how to dig into complex issues, automate the boring stuff, and keep critical environments running smoothly. I enjoy building and improving cloud setups, writing scripts in Python and PowerShell to save time, and using tools like CloudWatch, Sumo Logic, and Kibana to keep systems transparent and reliable. These days, I’m focused on leveling up in DevOps—bringing automation, observability, and efficiency together to make cloud operations seamless.\n\nWhen I'm not working on cloud projects, you can find me on my bike, hiking with my dogs or traveling with my wife. I'm always eager to connect with fellow tech enthusiasts and explore new opportunities in the cloud computing space.",
