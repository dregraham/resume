    "bio": "Cloud Engineer who learns by building things and understanding how they actually work (and fail). My background is in supporting AWS-hosted production environments, where I troubleshoot complex issues, analyze logs, and work across teams to restore stability. \n\nI enjoy building systems end to end so I understand every layer, making it more clean, stable and easy for the next person to operate. \n\nWhen I'm not in front of computer screens or buried in pipelines, I'm usually on my bike, hiking with my dogs, or traveling with my wife. I'm always down to connect with other builders and explore what's next in the cloud space.",
