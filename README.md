# Dre's Resume Project

### 


## Deployment
**React** was used for background elements: [https://github.com/lindelof/particles-bg](https://github.com/lindelof/particles-bg). 
DNS was provided by **Route53**.
AWS Amplify was initially used for deployment but I wanted more control over the CI/CD process so I transitioned to GitHub Pages.
