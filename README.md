## ☁️ Featured Project: Cloud Health Dashboard

### 📊 Overview
The **Cloud Health Dashboard** is a React-based simulation of the **AWS Service Health Console**.  
It demonstrates how a front-end interface can visualize service uptime, region health, and metric data across multiple AWS services using mock JSON data and simulated Lambda (boto3) interactions.

🧩 Built with:
- React (front-end framework)
- CSS3 (custom portfolio styling)
- JSON (mock service datasets)
- AWS concepts (CloudWatch, Lambda, Health APIs)

🎨 **Key Features:**
- Dynamic health status cards for AWS services  
- Dataset selector (Core, Compute, Security, Databases, DevOps)  
- Interactive modal pop-outs with tabs for Overview, Metrics, and Backend Logs  
- Modern black-and-white portfolio theme

## 🧠 Why I Built It
This project showcases my ability to:
- Translate **AWS architecture concepts** into functional code.  
- Simulate **real-time monitoring** workflows.  
- Design **clean, professional dashboards** aligned with cloud-engineering best practices.
